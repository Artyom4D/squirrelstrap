# Squirrelstrap

Set of [Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) templates for faster front-end web development. You can use them as example or as a base for your own templates.

## Installation

1. Install [Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) via `npm install -g grunt`.

1. Place templates into `~/.grunt/tasks/init` or `%USERPROFILE%\.grunt\tasks\init\` folder.

1. Edit `defaults.json`.

Now you can type something like this:

```bash
grunt init:templatename
```

In example `grunt init:readme` will make `Readme.md` and `License.md` files with your copyright information in current folder.
